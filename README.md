# hello-world
My first git rep
I am just a Techno geek,always trying to learn new things. I love object oriented programming.I easily understand technologies like C,C++,Java,PEGA,Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. I designed or conditioned my brain to be a manager rather than a developer. 
That is why I am late here!!!


But hey,I am built to try new things(The 2 min rule) and solve problems. So why not give GIT a try :)
